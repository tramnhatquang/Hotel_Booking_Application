# Hotel_Booking_Application

Hotel Booking Application is a website application that allows users to search hotels and manage their bookings quickly and conveniently. The application supports hotel searching functionality based on the hotel name, city/state, and date range. Also, it supports suggestive filtering based on price, amenities, and hotel ratings. Users can control their bookings by editing, canceling, and confirming bookings based on their needs. In addition, users can leave reviews and rate hotels from the website application. Admin Role can manage users, add, update, and control hotel info, and delete reviews. I utilized Microservices and RESTful API to implement this project.


## Back-end Technologies:
- Implemented using Spring Boot.
- Utilized Spring Rest Template to develop RESTful web services supporting XML and JSON.
- Architected Spring Security to implement authentication and authorization of users.
- Used Java Mail API to send booking confirmations.
- Tested REST services with Postman.
- Managed source code versioning using GitHub.

## Front-end Technologies:
- Implemented user interfaces using Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS.
- Utilized Ajax and JQuery to help with services communication to two back-end microservices
- Engineered JavaScript, CSS, and Bootstrap to enhance the user-friendly interface.
- Managed source code with Git and remote repository GitHub.
